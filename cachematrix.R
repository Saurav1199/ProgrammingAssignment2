## a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## we are finding the inverse of a matrix with this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  #solve is used to find the inverse of a matrix
m<-solve(x)

}


## We are finding an efficient way of finding inverse of a matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'if it exists else it calculates and returns
  if (!is.null(m)){
    m  }
  else solve(x)
}
